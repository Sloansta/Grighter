# Grighter

Grighter is a proof of concept script that allows the user to manipulate files (Text/Code files) in the terminal, without "Opening" the said file. 

# Proof Of Concept
Grighter is just one of my "intro" Golang projects, as i am new to the langauge. Grighter is meant to be used for small files, or writing small edits. 

# Pros:
Grighter is perfect for those "Oh shoot, i forgot to add an address to the ending of my text file!" type moments. Just use Grighter to add to the file, and don't worry about it!

# Commands/How to use:

Grighter has 2 commands, as of now. You can Create a new file, and write to it, *or* you can open an existing file, see it's contents, and then write to it. The commands are as followed:
  
###    Create and write to file:
      $ ./Grighter create filename.txt
    
###    Open and Write to existing file:
      $ ./Grighter ow filename.txt
